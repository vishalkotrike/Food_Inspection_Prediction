Analyzing and Forecasting Food Safety Compliance in Chicago Restaurants: Predicting Violations and Future Trends

Problem Statement: The recent Salmonella outbreak associated with a Chicago taqueria, affecting over 55 individuals, underscores a critical food safety challenge in the city. 
This incident highlights how important it is to have strict oversight and preventative measures in place to protect health of Chicago residents and safety when they eat out. 
Our project's objectives are to investigate the outbreak, pinpoint its origins, and evaluate any gaps in food safety procedures that might have contributed to the event. 

In this project, we are have achieved the following:

Predictions and Forecasts:
•	Develop a model to predict the Inspection outcomes.
•	Develop a model to assess the risk levels associated with different facility types.
•	Choose the classification model that best fits this dataset by comparing them.
•	Displaying the output and conclusions of the model

Analysis:
•	Identify the most common facility type in the dataset and facility types that are associated with highest and lowest risk factors.
•	Create geospatial maps, visualizing the distribution of food establishments and their risk levels across different locations.
•	Perform a time series analysis on the dataset, considering features such as Inspection Date.
•	Investigate the correlation between different features (e.g., Facility Type, Inspection Type) and the risk level.
•	Examine the types of violations reported and their frequency.
